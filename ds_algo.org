* my observations
** different kinds of operations on trees
*** adding a node
*** deletion
*** verifying if leaf
*** accessing parent or child
*** traversing
* good rich
** trees
*** see which methods exist with tree and which stay with node and find out why is that
*** why adding ( blindly in _parenthesize_recur
*** while writing code make a note of which method is with tree or node
** examples where I've constructed trees in
*** expression tree
**** only used __init__ and attach
*** Hierarchy
**** findout methods introduced at different hierarchy level
**** findout methods for addition, deletion and arguments taken by their methods
** priority queue
***
