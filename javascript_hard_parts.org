* higher order function
** A function that takes other function as input or returns as output
* closure
** The inner function gets the enclosing (lexical)scope attached to it
** before garbage collecting enclosing scope javascript leaves out the variables referenced in innner function
** lexical scope (the available live data when our function was defined) is what determines our available variables and prioritizatoin at function execution, not where our function is called
