* Web Components
** suite of different technologies allowing you to create reusable custom elements
** their functionality encapsulated away from the rest of your code — and utilize them in your web apps.
** consists of three main technologies
*** Custom elements
**** A set of JavaScript APIs that allow you to define custom elements and their behavior, which can then be used as desired in your user interface.
*** Shadow DOM
**** A set of JavaScript APIs for attaching an encapsulated "shadow" DOM tree to an element
**** rendered separately from the main document DOM
**** they can be scripted and styled without the fear of collision with other parts of the document.
*** HTML templates
**** The <template> and <slot> elements enable you to write markup templates that are not displayed in the rendered page. These can then be reused multiple times as the basis of a custom element's structure.
