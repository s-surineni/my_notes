* Two things Object.is misses is NaN and -0
* checking for Nan is Number.isNan
* checking for -0 is by 1/-0 gives negative infinity
* Infinity is built in in javascript
* another way to check for Nan is Nan != Nan should be true
* Fundamental Objects
** with which we will use new keyword
** Don't use new
** spend more time on this
** new will costruct objects
** not new will change them into primitive types
* conversion or coercion
** ToPrimitive keeps on calling itself unless it gets a primitive value
** toString
*** -0 toString give "0"
* To see the contents of object you can use JSON.stringify
* toBoolean is a lookup and in javascript [] is true
