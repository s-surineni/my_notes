* relational databases
** database is collection of data
** features of database
*** persistence
*** shared source of truth (accessible by many users)
*** Ability to store many types of data(efficiently)
*** concurrency control (multiple people can read and write at once)
*** rules for enforcing data integrity
** primary keys and foreign keys
*** every row must have a primary key to identify it uniquely
*** primary key could be compose of more than one column which is called composite key
*** foreign keys are responsible for joining tables
** SQL
** execution plan
** client-server model
** TCP/IP
*** postgres supports tcp/ip
*** uses ip addresses and ports to send communication back and forth between clients and servers on tcp/ip networks
*** for computer a port is tied to some physical location that exists on computers motherboard
*** port 80 is typically used for http requests
** connection and sessions in tcp/ip
*** tcp/ip is a connection based protocol
*** that means to start to have communication a connection must be arranged first and must close connection too
*** if more connections are opened and not closed there may be performance issues
*** session marks start and end of connection
*** session can also be thought as period between the start and end of connection
*** within a session we encapsulate interaction between a client and a server in units called as transaction
** Transactions
*** transaction are atomic units of work for the database to perform as a whole
*** all changes to data are made through units of work called transactions
*** an operation either succeeds or fails altogether as a unit
*** queue up work by using transaction.add and commit at once by using transaction.commit
*** a transaction can be cleared using command called transaction.rollback
** psql
*** interactive terminal that comes with postgres
