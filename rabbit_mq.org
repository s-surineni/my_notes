* open source messaging system
* uses amqp protocol
* written in erlang
* erlang supports distributed fault tolerant applications
* built for telecom applications
* rabbitmq server is a message broker. works as message coordinator for applications
* features
** reliability
** routing
*** works by routing messages through exchanges before stored in a queue
*** there are different exchange types
*** clustering and high availability
**** we can cluster several servers together which forms a single logical message broker
**** queues can be mirrored across multiple servers
*** management web interface
*** command line interface
* a queue is a temporary storage location, which sends are receives messages when conditions permit
* rabbit mq is centralized
* questions
** what is the message store
** how does it decide which message goes to which consumer if there are multiple consumers of same type
** how failed messages are reprocessed
** how is queue implmented
*** is it cache, db or file
* ways to know internals
** build an example and see the internals through webui
* simpler alternatives
