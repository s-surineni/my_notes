* use cases
** ride sharing
** financial transactions
* lambda architecture
** parallel batch systems
** realtime systems
** tension in maintaining data models and code that does aggregations in two parallel is a burden
** answering certain queries across systems becomes a huge problem
** moving towards event based system and realtime system we may do away with batch processing
*** but we are not able to do away with batch systems yet. batch and realtime systems may be complimentary
