* Puppet is a tool that helps you manage and automate the configuration of servers.
* When you use Puppet, you define the desired state of the systems in your infrastructure that you want to manage
* When you use Puppet, you define the desired state of the systems in your infrastructure that you want to manage
* Puppet code is declarative, which means that you describe the desired state of your systems, not the steps needed to get there.
* The Puppet primary server is the server that stores the code that defines your desired state. The Puppet agent translates your code into commands and then executes it on the systems you specify, in what is called a Puppet run.
* puppet platform - parts of puppet
** puppetserver
** puppetdb
** puppet-agent
** Facter
** Hiera.
* infrastructure as code
*
* declarative
* helps manage configuration of servers
* why configuration management
** deploying server with consistent configuration
** remediating configuration drift
** deploying application to clients in predictable and reliable manner
** everything should be automated
* scripts for infrastructure automation is not advisable
** because they are procedural and we have to manage everything ourselves
** not portable(bash, package manager)
* puppet has clent server architecture
* idempotency
* tools used
** ip
** ip addr show
** nmcli
** sudo nmcli connection modify example ipv4.gateway "192.0.2.1"
** ip r s shows default gateway
** hostnamectl changes hostname
** puppet agent -t # to see error with puppet agent
** firewall-cmd --add-port=8140/tcp --perm
** signed certificate with
#+begin_src shell
puppetserver ca sign --certname agent.globmantics.loc
#+end_src
** hostnamectl set-hostname puppet.globmantics.loc
** postgresql-setup initdb
** sudo -iu postgres
** createuser -P pasture
** createdb -E utf8 -O pasture pasturedb
** echo "listen_addresses = '*'" >> /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf
** echo "host  pasturedb  pasture  192.168.240.128/24  md5" >> /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf
** firewall-cmd --add-port=5432/tcp
** firewall-cmd --add-port=5432/tcp --perm
* resource
** resource are fundamental building blocks in puppet
* puppet config print modulepath
* systemctl enable --now ntpd puppet
* bolt command run 'puppet agent -t' --targets 10.10.10.112
* puppetserver ca sign --certname pasture.globomantics.loc
* ssh-copy-id
*  bold command run 'curl localhost/api/v1/cowsay' -- targets
* puppet module list
* puppet module install name
* troubleshooting
** if puppet apply -t fails from master try it on agent
* bolt command run "curl -X POST 'localhost/api/v1/cowsay/sayings?message=Welcome_To_Automation'" --targets 192.168.240.138
