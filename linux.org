above two should be done together

**  I just did "bootstrap bundle:core-app" and open a new window. it resolved my issue.

It should prompt for your p4 settings and save them where they need to go.
bootstrap bundle:core-app

* installation
** better to keep separate /var directory hierarchy in separate partition, so system log wont overwhelm rest of the system
* how boot process works
** motherboards have mini operating system hard coded into hardware
** old one is bios new one is uefi
** it looks for MBR(master book record)
** it loads GRUB bootloader into
** GRUB loads os kernel into memory
** vmlinux is compressed version of working linux kernel
* run level
** codes that tell linux how os should be running
** use systemctl to set run level
** change run level by systemctl isolate rescue.target
** to change default run level use systemctl enable multi-user.target
* file system hierarchy
** everything in linux is a plain text file
** file system hierarchy standard
** root directory is /
** /bin is for binary files
** /sbin same as above but for only multi user sessions
** /dev provides pseudo files for physical and virtual devices
* configuring environment
** locale
*** controls spelling and number format
** localectl
** env get all environment variables
** export sets value in child shells too
** we can use type to find out how bash runs the command
** timezonectl is used to set timezone
* hard disk management
** df will display all block devices currently mounted on the system, along with mount point
** mount point is the location on file system where we can find drive and its contents
** df -ht ext4
* all devices dvd, usb and modem are represented as file in /dev directory
* /dev/sda is the first data drive read by the system
* /dev/sdb is the second drive in the system
* if device is not mounted check it with lsblk | grep sd
* mounting the device
** create new folder in media directory
** sudo mkdir /media/newplace
** mount using command sudo mount /dev/sdb2 /media/newplace
* show all devices connected to system dmesg
* get hardware details using lshw
* software management
** sources.list file is present in /etc/apt
** software categories
*** main
*** restricted
*** universe
*** mutliverse: restricted usage
** third party repositories are added in the folder /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ directory
** sudo apt update updates the software index
** apt search helps to search for software, description
** apt is replacement for apt-get
* desktop
** there are 3 majorly
*** cinnamon/mate
*** gnome
*** xfce
* server
** server is any computer on which there's at least one process running, whose job is to serve the needs of remote user, usually called client
* server virtualization
** subset of techniques for partitioning a subset of physical computer, and uses it to launch independent operating system
** the operating system would feel that it is running on its own machine
** for ubuntu its better to use lxc virtualization via the lxd environment
** systemctl start httpd to start process
** systemctl enable httpd to start process each time we start the system
** ip a get the ip address
** default webroot is /var/www/html
** nextcloud can be used as own opensource dropbox
** snap is a kind of virtual partition exist in file system inside its own isolated environment
* compiling code
