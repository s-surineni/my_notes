* Call stack
** Global execution context is added first in call stack
* functional programming
** pure functions
*** only consequence no side effects
**** side effect
***** may be it won't change the mutable values (side effects)
***** won't change any global values
***** if side effects exist it will be hard to test
**** consequence - it returns the result of function
** higher order functions
*** definition: A function that can take another function as parameter or returns a function
*** Ability to leave placeholder for data like we do for parameters
*** Nothing but passing a function as parameter to another function
*** in javascript also functions are first class objects
** we use callbacks and higher order functions in asynchronous programming
* local memory is also called variable environment
