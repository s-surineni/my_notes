* web development guidelines
** use semantic html
*** proper use of links and buttons
*** Avoid "clickable" <span>s or <div>s
** Build proper form HTML markup and relationships
*** form elements have associated visual <label>s
*** errors are clearly conveyed visually and to assistive technology
*** related fields are grouped in a <fieldset> with a <legend>
*** A placeholder attribute is not a substitute for a label
** Add alternative text to Informational icons & images and an empty alt attribute to Decorative images.
** Make sure your headings are in order; avoid skip-level headings, such as an <h3> immediately following an <h1>
** Ensure your UI is fully keyboard-accessible and follows expected keyboard interaction patterns.
** If your UI includes expandable sections, use proper HTML markup to indicate this behavior
* ARIA
** three types of attributes available in ARIA: roles, states, and properties.
** Roles
*** give semantic meaning to HTML elements that traditionally do not have any semantic meaning, such as <div> or <span>
* keyboard interaction
** keys to use
