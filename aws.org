* to authenticate to aws you need to install aws cli
* networking
** VPC
** Internet gateway
** route tables
** Network Access Control List(NACL)
*** Its like a firewall
** Availability zone
*** Any resource we create must be in one of subnets
*** A resource must be created in multiple availability zones, to have redundancy
*** A VPC spans all availability zones
*** Each availability zone will have a subnet
*** Subnets don't span multiple availability zones
* EC2
** Elastic Compute Cloud
** is like a desktop computer
** instance type
*** instance type determines hardware of host compter
**** compute, memory, storage
*** family, type
* AMI
** AMI is operating system + software + settings
** AMI parts are root volume template, launch permissions, block device mapping
* EBS
** Elastic Block Store
** volumes are attached to any EC2 instance
** persist independently from life of instance
** IOPS
*** I/O operations per second
*** larger the size more IOPS it has
** root volume, additional EBS volume
** ebs can be connected to ec2 in same availability zone only
** ebs volumes can be swapped between ec2 instances
** Snapshot
*** Image of ebs that can be used as backup
* Security groups
** Similar to NACL
** present at instance level
** Allow/deny rules work different from NACL
** virtual firewall for one or more instances
** cannot create deny rules
** contains separate rules for inbound and outbound traffic
** these are stateful. Any traffic allowed inside is allowed to exit the security group
** we can control the ips which connect to ec2 instance through ssh using security group
* NACL (Network Access Control List)
** Apply at subnet level
* ELB (Elastic Load Balancer)
** takes traffic coming from internet gateway and load balances between multiple ec2 instances
* IP addressing
** provides ec2 with public ip address
** ec2 has both public and private addresses
** private address allows instance to communicate within same VPC
** if we use non default VPC and subnet any new ec2 won't have a public IP address
** traffic flow
*** ec2 -> ip address -> security group -> NACL -> route table -> internet gateway -> internet
* Launching and ec2 instance
** generate key pair
** eth0 is private ip address
** if there is traffic issue check in NACL
** if it is allowing the right traffic or not
