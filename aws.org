* to authenticate to aws you need to install aws cli
* networking
** VPC
*** Logically isolated section of AWS
** Internet gateway
*** Like a modem on home network
*** provides vpc, connection to internet
*** Internet gateway can be detached for AWS
** route tables
*** contains set of rules that determine where network traffic is directed
*** rules look at destination and determine where the traffic is directed
** Network Access Control List(NACL)
*** Its like a firewall
*** optional layer of security
*** controls traffic in and out of one or more subnets
*** these are stateless
**** must specify different rules for inbound and outbound traffic
*** rules are processed in an order
** subnet
*** subsection of a network
*** subnet resides in on availability zone
*** you can create one or more subnets in an availability zone
** Availability zone
*** Any resource we create must be in one of subnets
*** A resource must be created in multiple availability zones, to have redundancy
*** A VPC spans all availability zones
*** Each availability zone will have a subnet
*** Subnets don't span multiple availability zones
*** we create our resources inside subnets
*** private subnets won't have connection to internet gateway
* EC2
** Elastic Compute Cloud
** is like a desktop computer
** instance type
*** instance type determines hardware of host compter
**** compute, memory, storage
*** family, type
* AMI
** AMI is operating system + software + settings
** AMI parts are root volume template, launch permissions, block device mapping
* EBS
** Elastic Block Store
** volumes are attached to any EC2 instance
** persist independently from life of instance
** IOPS
*** I/O operations per second
*** larger the size more IOPS it has
** root volume, additional EBS volume
** ebs can be connected to ec2 in same availability zone only
** ebs volumes can be swapped between ec2 instances
** Snapshot
*** Image of ebs that can be used as backup
* Security groups
** Similar to NACL
** present at instance level
** Allow/deny rules work different from NACL
** virtual firewall for one or more instances
** cannot create deny rules
** contains separate rules for inbound and outbound traffic
** these are stateful. Any traffic allowed inside is allowed to exit the security group
** we can control the ips which connect to ec2 instance through ssh using security group
* NACL (Network Access Control List)
** Apply at subnet level
* ELB (Elastic Load Balancer)
** takes traffic coming from internet gateway and load balances between multiple ec2 instances
* IP addressing
** provides ec2 with public ip address
** ec2 has both public and private addresses
** private address allows instance to communicate within same VPC
** if we use non default VPC and subnet any new ec2 won't have a public IP address
** traffic flow
*** ec2 -> ip address -> security group -> NACL -> route table -> internet gateway -> internet
* Launching and ec2 instance
** generate key pair
** eth0 is private ip address
** if there is traffic issue check in NACL
** if it is allowing the right traffic or not
* s3
** simple storage service
** root level folders are called buckets
** All bucket names must be unique
** storage class
*** storage cost
*** object availability
*** object durability
*** frequency of access
** object lifecycle
*** rules that govern moving of objects between different storage classes or deletion
** object versioning
* Databases
** RDS will be in private subnets
** RDS is relational database
*** Amazon Aurora
*** MySql
*** Maria
*** Postgres
*** Oracle
*** Microsoft SQL server
** AWS manager underlying database
** Dynamo is non relational database
** RDS database will be present in private subnet
*** this will be connected to route tables that cannot connect to public network
** SSH tunneling
***
* elastic load balancer
** distributes traffic between ec2 instances
** elasticity means ability to scale up or down
** can detect unhealthy instances and direct traffic only to healthy instances
** end user will have the address of ELB
** instances have to be in different availability zones
