* 2.1 Introducing Footprinting Concepts and Methodologies
** first step in the hacking methodology
** also called recon
** public info from things like  DNS, WHOIS
* 2.2 Performing Footprinting through Search Engines
** attackers  use these search engines to gather sensitive information that is exposed on the internet.
** exploit database or exploit DB
* 2.3 Performing Footprinting through Web Services and Websites
** An attacker can get a lot of information about a company or about an organization just navigating through their websites
** just navigating through their website
** get information about the organization and underlying systems by just looking at the digital certificates
** At the very minimum, you have the root CA, but you can also have subordinate CAs
** You may actually see that if the organization is using weak crypto algorithms for their implementation here.
** trying to see if they have a robot.TXT file
** website owners use these robots.TXT file to give instructions about their sites to web crawlers.
** you actually can get a lot of different information about different content that the website may actually have without even navigating through it
* 2.4 Performing Footprinting through Social Networking Sites
* 2.5 Exploring Shodan
** Shodan is an amazing platform tool to perform reconnaissance of what is actually exposed out on the internet
** scanning the internet 24/7 from many different locations around the world
** you will see that there are tons and tons of different devices that are exposed on the internet with misconfigurations, with tons of vulnerabilities that have not been patched and also with weak crypto implementations or default credentials.
* 2.6 Understanding Email Footprinting
** Maltego to find very interesting emails related to any type of company or domain
** the attacker can then use this email address to potentially find log-in pages or any type of systems related to hacker.org. Let's say that website may have a slash admin account or area.
* 2.7 Understanding Whois Footprinting
**  ICANN in short is the primary body that is in charge of
*** maintaining and the management of IP address space
***  allocation of the IP addresses to many organizations.
*** Also about protocol parameters and the Domain Name System or DNS management,
*** registration of domains, you know, across the world.
** who is utility
* 2.8 Understanding DNS Footprinting
** zone transfer attack
** zone transfer is, is a mechanism used by DNS servers to update another DNS server by transferring the  contents of their database
** DNS is structured as a hierarchy, so that whenever you request DNS information, your request is actually passed up this hierarchy until a DNS server is found that can resolve the domain name request
** authoritative name servers that will be able to resolve the hacker.org or secretcorp.org or pearson.com, cisco.com, et cetera
** Nslookup
** hacker.org has four different IP addresses, and is doing DNS round-robin
** host command
** DNS zone transfer attack
** The secondary name server starts the process by requesting an SOA record.
** And SOA stands for the start of authority record
** type of resource in the DNS system containing administrative information about that zone.
** SOS record is then sent to the secondary server
** SOA has a serial number that is higher than the secondary will have, then you will need an update.
** the attacker can get a lot of information about the organization using a zone transfer attack.
** we're actually using the dig command with the AXFR for the zone transfer, and we have two domains, @nsztm1.digininja, and then zone transfer me
#+begin_src bash
dig axfr @nsztml.digi.ninja zonetransfer.me
#+end_src
* 2.9 Understanding Network Footprinting
** DNS resolution using the host command to the domain hacker.org
** do a quick who is, to the first IP address in the results.
** network range that the first address that we selected belongs to
** attacker can now focus his efforts or her efforts on the range from the 185.199.111.0. So from .1 all the way to 254.
** You can use things as simple as a trace route to that IP address
** trace route becomes a little bit more relevant because now you are seeing things that may be in between. Probably firewalls that may be blocking the trace route, or the different structures like routers or layer three switches and so on
** on-premise performing a pen test, trace route becomes a little bit more relevant because now you are seeing things that may be in between. Probably firewalls that may be blocking the trace route, or the different structures like routers or layer three switches and so on, that may be in between your PC or your machine all the way to the target device.
* 2.10 Surveying Footprinting Tools
** popular tool that help you automate a lot of the open source intelligence on footprinting enumeration called Recon-NG
** it has different modules that you can install and use things like DNS, reconnaissance, host enumeration, domain enumerations and so on.
** Netcraft, which basically is a repository of DNS base information that is very useful for numerating sub domains of a company.
#+begin_src bash
marketplace install netcraft
#+end_src
** Brute_host, which is basically part of the domain host modules within the Recon-NG.
* 2.11 Understanding Footprinting Countermeasures
** start by creating some awareness among your employees about the dangers of social engineering
** limiting sensitive information that can be otherwise not thought of sensitive information.
** always encrypt things
** Using privacy services on WhoIs lookup database
** disable directory listings on web servers
** many organizations subscribe to the tools such as shodan
* 3: Scanning Networks
** The common path to discover these hosts is to scan those networks using easily-accessible tools to find hosts with services exposed.
* 3.2 Exploiting Scanning Tools
** metasploit is a framework for penetration testing
*** running the TCP port scanner against
** Nmap is a network mapper
** hping3
*** You can craft packets with hping
*** ping tool operating on ICMP
** https://owasp.org/www-community/Vulnerability_Scanning_Tools list of scanning tools
* 3.3 Understanding Host Discovery
** we need to detect hosts that are alive, as well as the services that are running on those hosts.
** There's three common methods used, ICMP scanning, ARP scanning, and passive listening using sniffing
** if you are on the same line segment that system does not have a firewall running that is blocking ICMP, then you should expect to see an echo reply
** ICMP scanning ping sweep.
*** if you wanted to determine what hosts are online on this entire network sub-net?
*** Nmap is commonly used for this task.
** in order for a system to talk on a network, it needs to know a destination IP address, of course. Right? And, it needs to know a destination Mac address.
** If you need to get outside of your sub-net, then you need to talk to a router.
** who has the Mac address for, in this case, this network's case, 10.1.0.1
** ARP is another way determine live systems
** A couple of more tools for scanning ICMP, Angry IP scanner and What's Up Gold.
** if you are able to put your wireless interface into promiscuous mode, you can just listen to those wireless frames as they're floating around
* 3.4 Network Scanning Overview
** Next step is to determine what services are up and running on those hosts
** Common tools for that Nmap and Hping
** several service scanning techniques that are common.
*** full open
*** idle
*** stealth
** two common routed layer four protocols tcp, udp
** TCP
*** ip protocol 6
** udp
*** ip protocol 17
* foot printing
** first step in hacking methodology
** we gather information in this step

* 1.4 information security controls, laws
** get out of jail free card and that is a statement or a document that your customer, right? will actually give you as the pen tester to basically prove that they are permitting you and they're allowing you to perform this type of testing and that you are authorized to basically demonstrate what an attacker can actually do
** computer fraud and abuse act
** national conference of state and legislatures.
** General Data Protection Regulation GDPR
* type of scanning we can do
** tcp connect scan
*** tries to establish a session
*** uses full 3 way hand shake syn, syn/ack, ack/rst
*** if syn > rst means port closed
*** if there are any network firewalls we may not even get reset
*** we can do syn flood by not sending reset after syn/syn/ack
*** we send reset to tell destination that it can tear down session
** xmas scan
*** in this we set fin, psh, urg flags to 1 in the header
*** if port is open you won't get any response
** null scan
*** TCP segment with no flag set
*** if we get no response port is open
*** if we get RST back port is closed
** idle scan
*** we will use a zombie host
**** someone unknowingly participating in this scan
*** we derive IP ID from zombie
*** we send SYN packet spoofing zombie IP
*** process
**** send SYN/ACK to zombie host
**** we will get RST back
**** there will be IP in that RST
**** we send SYN to destination with spoofed IP
**** if destination port is closed we will get RST to zombie
**** when we run SYN/ACK again, we'll get IP ID incremented by 1
**** we require zombie host to be silent
**** for port open IP ID will incremented by 2
**** operating system increments IP ID by one, for every packet it sends. it may increment it by some random number too
** inverse TCP flag scan
*** FIN/URG/PSH/NULL uses combination of these flags to determine if port is open
*** if port is open no response
*** if port is closed reset
** ACK flag scan
** network firewalls with stateful feature can filter these scans?
*** because these are invalid flag combinations
* network scanning tools
** nmap
** counter measures
*** stateful firewalls will protect from most but TCP connect and Half-open
*** IDS, IPS, signatures can detect those bad segment flags
*** proactively scan your assets b
oth from inside and outside
**** don't want to have a service that should be available on the inside of your network, be available on the outside
*** Filtering ICMP
**** Filter ICMP at least to and from the internet
**** Employ HIPS with behavior monitoring to detect and block scanning sources
* scanning network demo
** to find your ip do
#+begin_src
ip addr
#+end_src
** we can do nmap to find other systems in the network
#+begin_src
nmap -n -sn ip/mask
# -n means dont connvert to names
# -sn means arp scan
#+end_src
** next we do tcp scan
*** this is active scan
#+begin_src
nmap -sT -p1-1000 -Tinsane ip/mask
#+end_src
*** find default gateway
#+begin_src bash
ip router
#+end_src
** /etc/services is distributed by most linux/unix systems
* banner grabbing
** goal is to figure out the service on the machine and which OS it is running on
** two types active, passive
** active
*** we connect and try to get information
** passive
*** we sniff network, capture packets
** counter measures
*** apache gives ability to hide this info in response
*** we can return fals response
*** IIS has lockdown wizard
* scanning beyond ids and firewall
** these need access to something inside network already
** ssh tunneling
*** provides methods to tunnel network traffic
*** you can actually reverse proxy traffic through an SSH tunnel as well.
