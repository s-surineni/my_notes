* Real application cluster
* Oracle RAC allows multiple computers to run Oracle RDBMS software simultaneously while accessing a single database, thus providing clustering.
* In a non-RAC Oracle database, a single instance accesses a single database.
* This allows an application or user to connect to either computer and have access to a single coordinated set of data.
* The main aim of Oracle RAC is to implement a clustered database to provide performance, scalability and resilience & high availability of data at instance level.
