* singleton
** would not take any arguments while initializing
** if it takes arguments it would be factory
** lazily loaded singleton
*** just create instance in getInstance after checking the instance is null
** to make singleton thread safe
*** make instance field volatile
*** make it protected from reflection by adding RuntimeException inside constructor
*** inside getInstance we do double check locking mechanism and synchronized check
