* singleton
** would not take any arguments while initializing
** if it takes arguments it would be factory
** lazily loaded singleton
*** just create instance in getInstance after checking the instance is null
** to make singleton thread safe
*** make instance field volatile
*** make it protected from reflection by adding RuntimeException inside constructor
*** inside getInstance we do double check locking mechanism and synchronized check
* builder pattern
** Handle complex constructors
** makes object immutable after is constructed
** telescoping constructors
** no contract of what is a valid order <?>
** object became mutable by having setters
** Bean doesn't take any parameters for constructor <?>
** has inner class
** we can mandate that constructor must have some parameters
** It will have methods that return instance of builer
** The builder build method would return outer-class object containing builder instance
** designed first - may be it can't be modified later?
